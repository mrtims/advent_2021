Advent of Code 2021
===============
A dump of solutions for Advent of Code 2021, in Rust.

These are all pretty quick and dirty, and certainly shouldn't be relied upon as an example of *good code*. These are largely the first working solutions that came to mind.

The goal is only to practice Rust and pick up a few tricks, while attempting to solve the puzzles as quickly as possible.

These will be uploaded soon after completion, which will be nowhere near to getting on the leaderboard. I may take some time over the holidays to revise some solutions if and when I figure out nice ways to clean them up.

The rules I have set myself (and may break at any time) are:
- The program output does not need to be the complete answer (it may require manual post-processing)
- The program input does not need to be unmodified from the provided input (it may be manually pre-processed)
- Use only the Rust standard library (no external crates)
- Use as many iterators and iterator functions as possible
- Only add functions to lib.rs during the completion of a puzzle (no prep-work)
- The first commit for each day will be representative of a first-cut. A little clean-up and running clippy is allowed to protect my reputation, but no refactoring once the clock stops
